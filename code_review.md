## Remarks
+ file_utils not used
+ a lot of unused branches to be deleted
+ program does not handle more than 24 persons
+ Nina I only see "update readme" commits for you
+ git commits not meaningful "all of the work of 24 october" does not mean anything

## General remark
Project is working but I have doubts for the tasks distribution, please tell me in private message how you did build the code.
