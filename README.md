# Openspace seating managment

## Project mission

This project manages an open workspace with 6 tables, each containing 4 seats, represented in code through the Openspace class. The program allows you to organize seating assignments randomly for a given list of names, check for available seating, display the current seating arrangement, and save the seating data to an Excel file.

## Functionalities
